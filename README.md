### :pushpin: How to play

* Use the arrow keys to mover your snake: :arrow_up:, :arrow_down:, :arrow_left:, :arrow_right:
* As the snake eats the food, it will grow in length.
* If your snake bites any part of it's own body, it dies and its game over. ðŸ˜–
* If your snake hits any walls (the edges of the screen), it dies and its game over. ðŸ˜£

The game continues till the snake dies so play till you can!
